# app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

<!-- 1. Project Vision & Features
Let’s define what a “standard graded” E-Canteen app should do. Here’s a solid feature set for a real-world canteen ordering app:
Core Features
Authentication
User registration & login (email/password, optionally Google/Apple)
Role-based: Customer, Admin (for menu management)
Menu Browsing
View food items, categories, prices, images, descriptions
Cart & Ordering
Add/remove items to cart
Place orders
View order summary before checkout
Order History
See past orders, status (pending, completed, cancelled)
Admin Panel
Add/edit/remove menu items
View/manage orders
Profile & Logout
View/edit profile, logout
Bonus (if time permits)
Push notifications for order status
Payment integration (dummy or real)
Ratings/reviews
2. Stack Decision
Let’s pick tools that are fast to set up, reliable, and “standard” for mobile apps.
Frontend
Flutter (what you have) — for cross-platform mobile UI
Backend
Supabase (Recommended)
Why? Open-source, Postgres-based, easy auth, REST & realtime, no vendor lock-in, better than Firebase for SQL devs, free tier, easy to use.
Alternative: Custom Node.js backend (but more setup, not needed for this project)
Authentication
Supabase Auth (email/password, social logins)
Why? Easy, secure, no recaptcha hell, works well with Flutter.
Database
Supabase Postgres (built-in)
Why? SQL, scalable, easy to manage, works with Supabase Auth.
Storage
Supabase Storage (for food images)
3. Folder Structure (Flutter)
A clean, scalable folder structure for Flutter:
Apply to README.md
4. How Flutter Manages Frontend/Backend
Frontend: Flutter builds the UI, handles navigation, state, and user interaction.
Backend: You call APIs (Supabase) for data, auth, storage. No backend code in Flutter; you use Dart packages to talk to Supabase.
State Management: Use Provider or Riverpod for app-wide state (cart, user, etc.).
5. Step-by-Step Plan
Step 1: Set Up Supabase
Create a free Supabase project (https://app.supabase.com)
Set up tables: users, menu_items, orders, order_items
Enable email/password auth
Step 2: Set Up Flutter Project
Install supabase_flutter package
Set up folder structure
Configure Supabase keys
Step 3: Implement Auth Flow
Registration, login, logout screens
Store user session
Step 4: Build Main Screens
Menu (fetch from Supabase)
Cart (local state)
Order placement (write to Supabase)
Order history (fetch from Supabase)
Admin panel (if user is admin)
Step 5: Polish UI
Use Material 3, nice cards, images, colors
Add loading, error states
Step 6: Test & Deploy
Test on Android/iOS/web
Prepare for deployment
6. Let’s Start!
First Task:
Go to https://app.supabase.com and create a new project.
Note your Supabase URL and anon/public API key (we’ll need these for Flutter).
Let me know when you’ve done this, and I’ll guide you through setting up your database tables and connecting Flutter to Supabase.
Summary:
We’ll use Flutter + Supabase (auth, Postgres, storage)
Clean folder structure
Focus on both backend and beautiful UI
I’ll guide you step-by-step, you just follow and ask questions as needed
Ready? Go create your Supabase project and tell me when you’re done! -->
